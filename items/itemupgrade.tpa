//2. Enhanced Carsomyr
COPY ~%MOD_FOLDER%/items/itemupgrade/LILARCO2.ITM~ ~override~
 SAY NAME2 ~Enhanced Carsomyr +6~
 SAY DESC ~The Holy Avenger: Carsomyr
Carsomyr is a weapon of legend, perhaps one of the most powerful blades ever forged on Faerûn, though its origin and history is thought purposefully forgotten so that the sword itself shall never overshadow the importance of the struggles that must be fought today. It is infused with the very essence of virtue and requires as much from any Paladin who would hope to wield it. The evils of the realms must truly stand aside when this weapon is brought to bear, their magic dispelled with a word, steadfastly resisted with ease. Carsomyr also harbors a special distaste for the forces of evil and chaos, and such creatures must fear additional damage from its touch in battle.

This enhanced Carsomyr was forged by Cromwell by combining the original Lilarcor with the powerful Carsomyr that only paladins could use. The enhanced Carsomyr is made even greater than the original Carsomyr and may be used by any fighting class.

//3. Selune's Promise +5
COPY ~%MOD_FOLDER%/items/itemupgrade/SIMACE3.ITM~ ~override~
 SAY NAME2 ~Selune's Promise +5~
 SAY DESC ~A weapon once owned by a grief-stricken high priestess of the Moonmaiden, Selune's Promise has a short and sad history. Fassa the Melancholy (as she is now known) was the head of a band of Selunite adventurers dedicated to destroying undead creatures wherever they found them. The band was initially quite successful, rarely suffering any casualties. Tymora's luck could not stay with them forever, though.

In 1156, Fassa and her band entered the Sepulcher of the Dim. The band knew the Sepulcher was rumored to contain a "leak" to the Negative Material Plane, but they had no idea just how many undead creations were inside. Mixed in with the seemingly harmless poltergeists and phantoms were powerful spectres and wraiths. Over a short and chillingly quiet period of several minutes, almost all of Fassa's allies had their vital energy drained away. Fassa and her remaining companions fled and tried to form a plan of attack. When they returned on the following night, all of Fassa's former companions had been turned into slave spectres under the control of the master. She and her few remaining comrades destroyed the master spectre and eventually destroyed the souls of her tormented brethren. In the end, Fassa was the only one left alive.

Fassa returned to her temple in misery and prayed to Selune that she never forget the agony of that night. Selune granted her request by causing a ghostly white and blue mace to appear on her bed when the next full moon rose. Carved into the shaft of the club were two words: Never Forget.

Fassa became almost fanatical in her undead hunting in later years. At the age of thirty-three, tired and bitter, Fassa fell into decline. On the night of a full moon, she renounced her faith to Selune in front of her superiors and fellow clergy. Hours later, she threw herself into the Moonsea from a high cliff. The mace was found in her room and reluctantly kept in the church. Many years later, the new high priest of the temple decided to bestow this unique weapon to a new promising priestess. This mace was the favourite weapon of Sime's mother.

It turns to be that Cromwell inherited the secret knowledge from his ancestors of rithelium weapons and how to forge them. This mace that he reforged with rithelium and with your assistance is extremely light and gives off a shimmering blue hue. It is usable by wizards as if proficient in their use, grants magical resistance to the wearer and can strike through magical defences of the enemies.

COPY ~%MOD_FOLDER%/items/itemupgrade/ROBEARM2.ITM~ ~override~
 SAY NAME2 ~Enhanced Robe of Armory~
 SAY DESC ~There are a small number of these valuable robes floating around the Realms, and all of them are the creation of an abjurer named Delgam of the Many Hands - so called for his extensive use of the expression "on the other hand..." Delgam eschewed imbuing his items with offensive powers or other miscellaneous magic effects. Instead, he focused on what abjurers tend to focus on: defense. His robes were extremely popular, so much so that mages were coming to him from all over the world to demand that he make more for them. Delgam decided to fade into obscurity rather than cater to packs of power-hungry wizards. His robes are his most well known legacy.

This particular robe was enhanced by Cromwell.

//5. Enhanced Staff of Besieging
COPY ~%MOD_FOLDER%/items/itemupgrade/STAFFBE2.ITM~ ~override~
 SAY NAME2 ~Staff of Besieging~
 SAY DESC ~A favorite among transmuters, this particular staff was created by a wizard named Gulph the Tiny. A diminutive human mage, Gulph didn't want to be stuck in a situation where he would have to rely on his physical abilities. This staff helped him have the upper hand in magical duels. Gulph met his end when he foolishly went looking for Ibenian Mushrooms in a grove full of quicklings. The staff remained among the quicklings for several years until a passing party of adventurers slaughtered the evil fae creatures and took the staff as their own.

This staff was combined with the Staff of Super Power and enhanced further by Cromwell.

//6. Enhanced Messenger of Sseth
COPY ~%MOD_FOLDER%/items/itemupgrade/BOWMESS2.ITM~ ~override~
 SAY NAME2 ~Enhanced Messenger of Sseth~
 SAY DESC ~This wicked bow was crafted thousands of years ago for a powerful yuan-ti archer named Apali. The number of men, women, and children Apali killed with the aid of the bow is almost unbelievable, as the soldier waged war against humans for hundreds of years before he was finally laid low in Chessenta by a priest of Assuran, god of vengeance. Apali had killed the priest's great-great grandfather in Chult over a hundred years earlier. The item is easily recognized because of the red and black banding on the grip and the carved snake heads at the ends of the bow. The red and black bandings represent Apali's family, from a caste of priests. The snake heads represent Sseth, the god of the yuan-ti.

Cromwell combined the three most powerfull bows into one to forge this unique composite long bow for you.

 SAY DESC ~Flame Tongue +4 (Enhanced by Cromwell)

There was a time before Neverwinter was warm and before the great Anauroch was dry... or so it is said. Few relics remain to prove such an age existed, and fewer still have an identifiable purpose. "The Burning Earth" seems straightforward enough - it burns a victim with magical fire, and a cryptic rune seems to suggest that the power comes from the ground itself- but whomever constructed it remains a mystery. It looks a perfectly serviceable weapon, but something in the balance or grip is... wrong. It strains the forearm a touch, and does not fit the hand just right. It doesn't seem to hurt a warrior's performance, aside from the nagging doubt that the blade was not made for him... or any other humanoid.

Combined with the Hell Bane sword, this weapon is also the bane of certain lower planes creatures and vampires. Against Baatezu and Tanar'ri the sword inflicts additional damage and the user gains a +4 to both hit and damage. As for vampires, the sword has a chance to slain them on touch. While held, the sword also grants complete protection against poison, disease and fire being magical or not.

 SAY NAME2 ~Crimson Dragon Scale~
 SAY DESC ~This suit of armor is formed from interlocking crimson dragon scales. It is light of weight, strong, and resistant to fire and magic. Because of these properties it is much sought after, but finding, let alone slaying, a powerful ancient dragon is nearly impossible. It is usually easier to search for an existing suit, such as this one. One should be careful wearing it near dragons, however, particularly crimson ones.

 SAY DESC ~Silver Sword (enhanted by Cespenar)
This is truly a legendary weapon called Vorpal or Silver Sword. No wonder that githyanki wanted to procure it so much and return it to their ancestral city of Tu'narath. Vorpal is their ritual sword radiating a dark aura when you examine it, and the blade is so finely sharpened it could likely sever a head in a single blow.

Besides bein a ritual sword, Vorpal also serves the purpose of getting rid the world of the hateful illithids. Those who wield the Vorpal have a complete mind shield including immunity to charm, domination, confusion and psionics. In addition, the sword provides the wearer the freedom to move under any movement-alterating spells.

 SAY DESC ~Blade Of The Night (enhanted by Cespenar)
This was the weapon used by the most famous assassin in Kara Tur, but none knew her name apart from the emperor. She was the greatest thief the world had ever seen. She received this powerful weapon after completing a series of succesful missions for the emperor, who decided she was worthy of the blade. It was made by the emperors best weapon smiths, and then tempered in the bloods of red, black, silver and blue dragons. The legend says this weapon would make anyone almost as good as thief as the original owner, but because of the strong enchantments, the katana requires much from its wielder, and it is only usable by a thief.
